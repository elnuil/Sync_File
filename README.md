I encountered a technical challenge, and I used external resources to help me arrive at a solution. Here's how I approached the problem:

I started checking for similar problems on the internet.
I found a couple of helpful code snippets and tried to modify it.
I adapted and customized the code to suit the specific requirements of the problem.
I want to give full credit to the original source that helped me in this process. Please visit the original source for additional context and information.

I restructured the code to make it more organized and easier to read. I replaced the file copying method with  using the 'shutil' library to ensure file metadata is preserved during copying. The code runs in an infinite loop with a 1 hour interval for periodic synchronization and logs messages with timestamps for tracking. 

Please note that this solution was developed as part of a process, and I am sharing it here for transparency and to showcase my problem-solving skills.
